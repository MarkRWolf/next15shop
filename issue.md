## Issue Summary

I'm experiencing an issue with Sanity's type generation in my Next.js 15 application when using GROQ queries. Specifically, when I project over fields that are defined as required in my schema, the generated TypeScript types include null, even though these fields cannot be null.

## Details

### 1. Price Field Example

**Schema Definition:**

```javascript
// In the schema, 'price' is a required field of type 'number'
{
    name: 'price',
    type: 'number',
    validation: Rule => Rule.required(),
}
```

**GROQ Queries and Generated Types:**

Note: All queries include `!(_id in path("drafts.*"))` to exclude draft documents.

**Query without explicit projection:**

```groq
*[_type == "product" && !(_id in path("drafts.*"))] { ..., }
```

**Generated TypeScript type:**

```typescript
price: number; // as expected
```

**Query with explicit projection:**

```groq
*[_type == "product" && !(_id in path("drafts.*"))] { ..., price }
```

**Generated TypeScript type:**

```typescript
price: number | null; // includes null unexpectedly
```

### 2. Names Array with References

**Schema Definition:**

```javascript
// 'names' is a required array of objects containing 'name' and a reference to 'language'
{
    name: 'names',
    type: 'array',
    of: [
        {
            type: 'object',
            fields: [
                { name: 'name', type: 'string', validation: Rule => Rule.required() },
                { name: 'lang', type: 'reference', to: [{ type: 'language' }], validation: Rule => Rule.required() },
            ],
            validation: Rule => Rule.required(),
        },
    ],
    validation: Rule => Rule.required(),
}
```

**GROQ Query:**

```groq
*[_type == "product" && !(_id in path("drafts.*"))] {
    ...,
    names: names[]{ ..., "language": lang->name }
}
```

**Generated TypeScript type:**

```typescript
names: Array<...> | null; // includes null unexpectedly
```

## Attempts to Resolve

### Using coalesce:

For scalar fields like price, using `coalesce(price, 0)` removes null from the type.

```groq
*[_type == "product" && !(_id in path("drafts.*"))] { ..., "price": coalesce(price, 0) }
```

However, for arrays like names, using `coalesce(names[]{ ... }, [])` results in a type like `Array<...> | Array<never>`, which is not helpful.

```groq
*[_type == "product" && !(_id in path("drafts.*"))] {
    ...,
    "names": coalesce(names[]{ ..., "language": lang->name }, [])
}
```

### Filtering Defined Fields:

Using a query like `*[_type == "product" && defined(price) && defined(names) && !(_id in path("drafts.*"))]` does not prevent null from being included in the generated types.

```groq
*[_type == "product" && defined(price) && defined(names) && !(_id in path("drafts.*"))] { ..., names, price }
```

## Impact

- The inclusion of null in the types forces unnecessary null checks in the frontend code.
- This contradicts the schema definitions where these fields are required and cannot be null.

## Question

Is there a way to make the type generator respect the schema's required fields when generating TypeScript types, so that null is not included for fields that cannot be null?

Alternatively, is there a way to adjust the GROQ queries to ensure that the generated types accurately reflect the non-nullable nature of these fields?

## Additional Context

- This issue affects the type safety of my application.
- Using non-null assertions like `product.names!.map(...)` is not considered a viable solution.
